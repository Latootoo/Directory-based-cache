# Directory-based-cache
This repository contains a synthesizable Verilog code for L1 cache and Directory+L2 cache. The project is done as part of the course work VLSI Design Laboratory at University of Minnesota - Twin cities. 

The cache file models L1 tag and data arrays along with the cache controller and MOESI FSM. The signal and feature dscriptions are provided in the comments of the .v file.

The directory file models L2 tag and data arrays along with the L2 cache controller and MOESI FSM. The signal and feature dscriptions are provided in the comments of the .v file.
